abstract = {Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems are paving their path for a revolutionized world in which majority of our objects of everyday use will be interconnected. These objects will be able to link and communicate with each other and their surroundings in order to automate majority of our tasks. This interconnection of IoT nodes require security, seamless authentication, robustness and easy maintenance services. In order to provide such salient features, blockchain comes out as a viable solution. The decentralized nature of blockchain has resolved many security, maintenance, and authentication issues of IoT systems. Therefore, an immense increase in applications of blockchain-based IoT systems can be seen from the past few years. However, blockchain-based IoT network is public, so transactional details and encrypted keys are open and visible to everybody in that network. Thus, any adversary can infer critical information of users from this public infrastructure. In this paper, we discuss the privacy issues caused due to integration of blockchain in IoT applications by focusing over the applications of our daily use. Furthermore, we discuss implementation of five privacy preservation strategies in blockchain-based IoT systems named as anonymization, encryption, private contract, mixing, and differential privacy. Finally, we discuss challenges, and future directions for research in privacy preservation of blockchain-based IoT systems. This paper can serve as a basis of development of future privacy preservation strategies to address several privacy problems of IoT systems operating over blockchain.}

abstract = {Traceability plays a vital role in food quality and safety management. Traditional Internet of Things (IoT) traceability systems provide the feasible solutions for the quality monitoring and traceability of food supply chains. However, most of the IoT solutions rely on the centralized server-client paradigm that makes it difficult for consumers to acquire all transaction information and to track the origins of products. Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that has great potential for improving traceability performance by providing security and full transparency. However, the benefits, challenges and development methods of blockchain-based food traceability systems are not yet fully explored in the current literature. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to review the blockchain technology characteristics and functionalities, identify blockchain-based solutions for addressing food traceability concerns, highlight the benefits and challenges of blockchain-based traceability systems implementation, and help researchers and practitioners to apply blockchain technology based food traceability systems by proposing an architecture design framework and suitability application analysis flowchart of blockchain based food traceability systems. The results of this study contribute to better understanding and knowledge on how to improve the food traceability by developing and implementing blockchain-based traceability systems. The paper provides valuable information for researchers and practitioners on the use of blockchain-based food traceability management and has a positive effect on the improvement of food sustainability.}
